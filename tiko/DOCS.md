To use this add-on, you need:

* A tiko / Mon Pilotage Elec account
* A running MQTT broker, you can use the one from the Mosquitto add-on
* The MQTT integration setup in Home Assistant with discovery enabled

Then, you just need to set `tiko email` and `tiko password` in the add-on configuration and start it. If you're not using the Mosquitto add-on, you'll also need to set `MQTT broker URL` and eventually `MQTT username` and `MQTT password`.
